## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS (via SCSS)
  - custom properties
  - Grid layout
  - pseudo-classes
  - pseudo-elements
  - CSS sprite
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Concerning the coloured top border of each card, when the border width is less than the radius of rounded corners, the border has to be displayed in a child element if we do not want the border to be rounded at the corners.

### Continued development

For this time, I did not feel I spent too much time carrying out this challenge.
